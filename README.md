# Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to build a machine learning classification model to accurately predict which customers on a specific shipping lane are at high risk of churning in the next quarter.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to build a classification model to predict customer churn for a specific shipping lane. By identifying at-risk customers, the business can proactively implement retention strategies, ultimately reducing revenue loss and improving customer loyalty.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Kevin-yyuan/customer_churn_prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd customer_churn_prediction
   ```

## How to Run

1.  **Generate the dataset:** Run the `data_generation.py` script to create the `customer_churn_data.csv` file in the `data` directory.

    ```bash
    python data_generation.py
    ```

2.  **Run the analysis:** Open the `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (like VS Code or Jupyter Lab) and run the cells sequentially. The notebook will perform the data analysis, train the model, and save the evaluation plots in the `images` directory.

## Project Structure

- `data_generation.py`: A Python script to generate the sample customer churn dataset.
- `customer_churn_analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the full end-to-end analysis, from data loading to model interpretation.
- `analysis_report.md`: A Markdown file summarizing the key findings and recommendations.
- `presentation.md`: A Markdown file with the content for a 3-5 slide presentation for business stakeholders.
- `data/`: A directory where the generated `customer_churn_data.csv` is stored.
- `images/`: A directory where the plots and charts generated by the notebook are saved.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed several key drivers of customer churn:

- **Customer Inactivity:** The number of days since a customer's last shipment is the most significant predictor of churn.
- **Contract Flexibility:** Customers on 'Month-to-month' contracts are more likely to churn than those on long-term contracts.
- **Service Strain:** A high number of support tickets is a strong indicator of customer dissatisfaction and potential churn.

Based on these findings, a set of actionable recommendations has been proposed to create a proactive customer retention strategy.
